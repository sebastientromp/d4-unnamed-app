# companion-orchestrator

This is used to decide which module to load. All windows use the same entry point, and the orchestrator is in charge of loading the correct component based on the window's name.
There should be little reason to modify this once the initial setup is done

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test companion-orchestrator` to execute the unit tests.
