# Ideas

## Name

-   Envoy(s) of Lilith
-   D4 Chaos (does not really sound really nice when you say it)
-   Aspect(s) of Lilith

## Static

-   Interactive map (by zone)
    -   https://mapgenie.io/diablo-4/maps/sanctuary
    -   https://diablo4.purediablo.com/map/
    -   first version could simply include a static map of the Alters of Lilith? https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/120hisw/alter_of_lilith_locations_fractured_peaks/
    -   "Alters of Lilith give Account Wide bonuses to stats. Most of them are +2 to one stat or another. These bonuses add up. In the full game, there are at least ~120 of them. Alters and revealing map locations as you travel give renown that also grants Account Wide bonuses such as skill points, potion capacity, and paragon."
-   Character builder / Skill tree calculator
    -   https://d4builds.gg/. Their UI is pretty clean, and probably easier to understand than the actual skill tree from the game
-   Encyclopedia
    -   list of aspects: https://dotgg.gg/diablo-4/aspects
    -   challenges: https://dotgg.gg/diablo-4/challenges

## With game events

-   DPS / damage taken counter
-   XP by second counter
-   Session recap (enemies killed, dungeons cleared, etc.)
    -   Also life-time stats
-   Be able to see item stats while on the ground (but probably too much work, and it's a likely QoL to be added by the game itself)
-   Item filter: hide all normal/rare items on the ground
-   Export current build. By coupling this with damage / time to clear dungeons, could show the best builds around

## What can I do until I have a GEP?

-   Interactive map. Not sure I want to start competing on that, since I will start with a huge disadvantage, never having built a map myself
-   Skill planner. Probably the same thing: there will be static websites doing this way better than I can, and the advantage of having it in-game is not really clear
-   Manually track visited locations: probably goes hand-to-hand with the map
-   Manually track encountered minions to check them off the list: why?
-   Manually track session:
    -   hit "session start", input current gold, level, class and XP
    -   hit "session end", input current gold, level, class and XP
        -> compute gold/xp per hour, as well as stores the info to build global stats
    -   same for "dungeon start" / "dungeon end"
    -   could also add a hotkey to ping when a legendary item drops
    -   using the first GEP events, maybe show a popup to ask the player to enter the info when starting a session? Worst case we don't have the info when the session closes, but use the next session's start of info to know how they fared in the last session?
-   The map overlay that I did as a proto
    -   that was useful, but goes back to the map concerns
-   Use OCR to parse charac stats and upload them somewhere?
-   OCR could be used to extract the unique items from a character build
